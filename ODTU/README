This is a specialized version of the PySkyAlmanac for Middle East
Technical University, 2017. It is bilingual and also includes a LaTeX wrapper to
present the chart along with some usage notes.
To get the chart use (do not type "> ", just what comes after that):
> python skyalmanac_biling.py
This will produce almanac_2017_ODTU_Fizik.eps
Then run:
> latex almanac_poster.tex
> dvips -Ppdf almanac_poster.dvi
> ps2pdf almanac_poster.ps
which should produce a nice PDF file.
    
If you want to skip creating Postscript file and go directly to PDF,
you first need to modify skyalmanac_biling.py to produce PDF file
by changing the last line (it should be clear if you look in there),
then translate METU logo into PDF with epstopdf script. Then you
should be good to go, I did not try this though.

have fun,
