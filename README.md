**I am no longer maintaining this project. If I wrote it again, I would write
it with completely different tools, but this does not interest me at the moment (January 2023). --ato **

This is program that prepares a chart similar to Sky & Telescope's
annual [*Skygazer's Almanac*](http://www.shopatsky.com/product/Skygazers-Almanac-2011-Wall-Chart/). 

The code is written in [Python](http://www.python.org/). It uses
[PyX](http://pyx.sourceforge.net/) for preparing the PDF output,
[PyEphem](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) for astronomical calculations,
and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) for a simple root-finding calculation.
PyEphem uses routines from
[XEphem](http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem/).

You can copy, modify and distribute the code under the terms of the
[GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). See
the file COPYING for more details. You can also freely distribute
the end product, the chart itself. If you want to give a reference to the
tool creating the chart, you can use the URL

This is in development stage and certainly has bugs. In addition, the
code is for Ankara and 2012. I tried to make it easy to adapt to
different locations and years; in particular, the comments and the
function names are in English. If you plan to port it to a different
locale (location, timeframe, language etc.) please let me know. I would
be more than happy to help out.
